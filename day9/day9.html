      Marvel counts among its characters such well-known superheroes as
      Spider-Man, Iron Man, Wolverine, Captain America, Black Widow, Thor, Hulk,
      Daredevil, Doctor Strange, Black Panther, Captain Marvel, and Deadpool, as
      well as popular superhero teams such as the Avengers, X-Men, Fantastic
      Four, and Guardians of the Galaxy. Its stable of well-known supervillains
      includes Doctor Doom, Magneto, Green Goblin, Kingpin, Red Skull, Loki,
      Ultron, Thanos, Kang the Conqueror, Venom, and Galactus. Most of Marvel's
      fictional characters operate in a single reality known as the Marvel
      Universe, with most locations mirroring real-life places; many major
      characters are based in New York City.[4] Additionally, Marvel has
      published several licensed properties from other companies. This includes
      Star Wars comics, twice from 1977 to 1987, and again since 2015.
